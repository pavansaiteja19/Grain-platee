# Grain-platee
Grainpalette, a deep learning-based solution for the classification of rice grains using transfer learning. By fine-tuning pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a diverse set of rice grain images, the model is able to accurately classify various rice types, overcoming the limitations
